# 🖌️ Drawtica — Gesture-Controlled Drawing with MediaPipe

Drawtica is a futuristic, browser-based drawing tool that lets you draw and erase using only hand gestures — no mouse, pen, or touchscreen required!

Built with **MediaPipe Hands** and **JavaScript**, it turns your webcam into an interactive sketchpad where:
- ☝️ Your **index finger** draws
- ✊ A **fist gesture** erases
- 🖼️ Live digital ink is projected on a black canvas
